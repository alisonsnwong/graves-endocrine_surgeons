In some counties, all Census Tracts in the county are eligible. You’ll see this note in the memo field: “This county is eligible even though it is designated as a Metropolitan County. All census tracts in the county qualify as rural.”
If there are no entries in the Census Tract cell or Memo field, then the entire county is eligible.
Note: This file includes rural areas in Puerto Rico and the US territories.
